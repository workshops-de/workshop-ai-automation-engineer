# AI Automation Engineer Workshop

A comprehensive 3-day workshop for learning intelligent automation with AI, Claude, and N8N.

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

This intensive workshop teaches you how to build intelligent automation solutions using modern AI technologies. You'll learn to design, implement, and deploy AI-powered workflows that can transform creative and business processes.

### What You'll Build

Throughout this workshop, you'll build **ContentFlow AI** - a sophisticated multi-agent content creation system that:
- 🎨 Generates images, videos, and audio using AI (fal.ai)
- 📝 Creates compelling written content across multiple formats
- 🖼️ Integrates stock photography from Unsplash/Pexels
- 🤖 Orchestrates multiple AI agents for different creative tasks
- 📊 Manages content pipelines from ideation to publication
- 🔄 Implements feedback loops and quality control

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Understanding of APIs and HTTP requests
- Familiarity with JSON data format
- Laptop with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Accounts for:
  - Claude AI (Anthropic)
  - N8N (self-hosted or cloud)
  - GitHub

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Software
