## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **AI Understanding**: LLMs are powerful but need clear instructions
2. **Prompt Quality**: Better prompts = better automation
3. **Process First**: Always map the process before automating
4. **Start Simple**: Build basic version, then enhance
5. **Error Handling**: Plan for AI failures from the start
